It assumes no prior programming experience.\n\n**Chapter 1: Getting Started with Java**\n\n*   **Summary:** This chapter introduces you to the world of Java and its importance. You'll learn what Java is, why it's used, and how to set up your development environment to start writing Java code.\n\n    * **Topics:**\n        ```json\n        {\n           \"topics\": [\n                {\"name\": \"What is Java?\", \"description\":\"Introduction to the Java programming language\"},\n                {\"name\":\"Why Use Java?\",\"description\":\"Applications and use cases of Java.\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Setting Up the Environment\", \"description\":\"Installing JDK and configuring your development environment.\"},\n                 {\"name\":\"First Java Program\",\"description\": \"Writing your first Hello World program\"}\n             ]\n        }\n        ```\n\n**Chapter 2: Understanding the Basics**\n\n*   **Summary:** This chapter dives into the fundamental building blocks of Java. You'll learn about data types, variables, operators, and how to perform simple calculations.\n\n    * **Topics:**\n        ```json\n        {\n            \"topics\": [\n                 {\"name\": \"Data Types\", \"description\":\"Understanding primitive data types (int, float, char, boolean, etc.).\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Variables\", \"description\":\"Declaring and initializing variables.\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Operators\", \"description\":\"Arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators.\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Basic Calculations\", \"description\":\"Performing simple mathematical calculations.\"}\n             ]\n         }\n        ```\n\n**Chapter 3: Control Flow**\n\n*   **Summary:** Here, you'll learn how to control the execution flow of your programs. You'll explore conditional statements (if-else) and looping structures (for, while).\n\n    * **Topics:**\n        ```json\n        {\n           \"topics\":[\n                {\"name\": \"Conditional Statements (if-else)\", \"description\":\"Making decisions in your program.\"},\n               {\"name\":\"Looping (for and while)\", \"description\":\"Repeating blocks of code using loops.\"}\n            ]\n        }\n        ```\n\n**Chapter 4: Working with Strings**\n\n*  **Summary:** This chapter focuses on how to work with text in Java.

by type, like 'users', 'posts', etc.</li>\n                    <li><strong>IDs:</strong>  Each entity is assigned a unique ID and stored in a lookup table.</li>\n                    <li><strong>References:</strong> Relationships between entities are represented by storing IDs.</li>\n                 </ul>\n            </li>\n            <li><strong>Study Points:</strong>\n

Structures</h4>\n        <ul>\n             <li><strong>What are Immutable Data Structures?</strong> Immutable data structures are structures that cannot be modified after creation.
